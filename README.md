# Mosaic-photo

This Jupyter Notebook generates an image composed by other images by matching average color of each tile with color of each pixel in original image.

This notebook requires two inputs: a base image and thousands of small images.

Then, it matches each small image with the corresponding pixel in the base image based on their color and average RGB value, thereby creating a mosaic image made up of a large number of images.

I am currently working on this project and it is not yet complete.

This notebook is currently written in Spanish, but I will be documenting it in English shortly.
